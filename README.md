Weather Forecast API Application

The application, built with Python and PostgreSQL, provides real-time weather forecasts and historical data through integration with the Forecast API. Users can browse past weather records and generate reports in Slovak or English, with the option to receive concise factual summaries or more engaging, dramatized articles. Hosted on AWS within Docker containers, the API ensures a scalable, flexible, and personalized user experience. A user-friendly GUI for testing is available through Swagger UI..
